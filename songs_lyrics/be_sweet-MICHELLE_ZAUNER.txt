Tell the men I'm coming
Tell them count the days
I can feel the night passing by like a mistake waiting for me
Caught up in my feelings
Overthink the truth
Fantasise you've left me behind and I'm turned back running for you
Make it up to me, you know it's better
Make it up to me, you know it's better
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe
Be sweet
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in something
So come and get your woman (come and get your woman)
Pacify her rage (pacify her rage)
Take the time to undo your lies, make it up once more with feeling
Recognise your mistakes and I'll let you back in
Realise not too late, love you always
Make it up to me, you know it's better
Make it up to me, you know it's better
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe
Be sweet
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in something
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe
Be sweet
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in something
