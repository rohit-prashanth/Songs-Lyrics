My sign is waiting, rise up until the curve bends over down
They'll entertain you, alleviate the now into its ground
We crash and then burn, water's rising, hypnotizing slowly as we flow
Gravitate to unlearn, every meaning soon up heaving
So then you keep turning
And you keep turning around
Keep turning 'till it all spins off somehow
Dizzy headed banshee of a, a phosphine capacity
Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down
Some shielding from the fighting
They bеat you from the left, they hit you from thе right
Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down
Shifting to a lower substation to let it swirl in the greater around
We become each other's sedatives, living shelter 'till the cloudburst dies down
We crash and then burn, damn it, I'm short of something to live for, free me from my thirst
Gravitate to unlearn, the simple abstract, brace for impact
So then you keep turning
And you keep turning around
Keep turning 'till it all spins off somehow
Dizzy headed banshee of a, a phosphine capacity
Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down
Some shielding from the fighting
They beat you from the left, they hit you from the right
Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down
Keep turning
And you keep turning around
Keep turning 'till it all spins off somehow
I've been yearning for it all to hit the ground (Ground)
