"I'm in control"
That's what I tell myself
When all the walls around me
Close in
And you
You have this way
You repeat all of the words
That everyone else says
And I know no one's waiting for anyone
Yeah, I know no one's waiting for anyone
I've come undone
I sliced it how
I'd rather feel the hurt
Separated
Thanks for watching me
Pleading out and over all your sheets
For cleaning me
And what I, what I need
Is just one real bitch
To set me free
I know no one's waiting for anyone
Yeah, I know no one's waiting for anyone
Yeah, I know no one's waiting for anyone
Yeah, I know I'm not waiting
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
Something's in your eyes
I know I'm not waiting
"I'm in control"
I know I'm not waiting
That's what I tell myself
