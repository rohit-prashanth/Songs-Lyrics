Hell yeah I saw an analog
There's a tower in the valley and it won't be long
There's a cross in the rocks by the roadside like
Copy in an ad workshopped on Slack so you'll say
"I clearly see the analog now"
Thank God I'm wrong all the time
I've been so wrong my whole life
And I'm tired of paying twice
Why can't both things be true?
Why can't both be true?
You're a fucking baby but your pain is valid too
And me, I'm not hurt
You're just dumb anyways
Yeah, you're dumb and it doesn't matter
Doesn't matter anyway
Out West they shot all the Buffalo
Pissed down the barrels of their red hot guns
Went around and skinned them but left them though
Their bones to blanche in the prairie sun
Their line's been passed down a hundred years now
With something jailers in a prison town know
Why can't both things be true?
Why can't both be true?
Thank God we're born free but just don't lose the keys
They hate our freedom but you can't turn anything off
