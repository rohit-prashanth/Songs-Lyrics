You say that I've been actin' different, yeah
Funny how I finally flipped the script on you
When you the one who's double-dippin', yeah
You so sloppy, how I caught you slippin' up
You're off the lease, run me my keys
No more poppin' up to hit it, yeah
I ain't even got the miles to trip on you
New phone (who is this?)
Brand new, like the whip
Rack it up, no assist
Main bitch I ain't average
Wake up, need a zip
Hennessy take a sip
I got my jeans, I'm too thick
I ain't got the room for extra baggage
Don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh, feelings
Don't leave no pieces (oh, oh)
You need to hurry and pick up your, ooh-ooh, feelings
While I'm up cleaning
Boy please, I don't need it (I don't need it)
Memories, all that shit, you can keep it (oh, oh)
Don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh-ooh, feelings
Don't leave no pieces (oh)
Oh, I'm tryna find a fuck to give for you
You ran out of chances of forgivin', yeah
Yeah, listen, I ain't listenin'
Just for you to go and break my heart again
I learned my lesson (last time)
Woah, and I ain't comin' (back now)
This is what you had now (had now)
And I bet you I look better, don't I?
New phone (who is this?)
Contact? Don't exist
Need a ride? Call that bitch
Gas way too expensive
No more, benefits
Pop-up visits
Hands tied, no grip
I ain't got the room for extra baggage
So don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh, feelings
And don't leave no pieces (hey, ayy)
You need to hurry and pick up your, (pick up your), feelings
While I'm up cleaning (oh, oh)
Boy please, I don't need you
Oh, oh, memories, all that shit, you can keep it (oh, oh)
Don't forget to come and pick up your, oh, feelings
Don't leave no pieces (oh)
Put a lock on the door where my heart once was, hmm
Boy you had your fun
But I had enough
Now I'm really done
I deserve so much more than you gave to me
So now I'm savin' me
And I made my peace
So you can run them streets
But don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh, feelings
And don't leave no pieces (Don't leave no)
You need to hurry and pick up your, ooh, feelings
While I'm up cleaning
Boy please (boy please, oh)
I don't need you (I don't need you)
All that shit (all that shit)
You can keep it (you can keep it), I don't need it (I don't need it)
Don't forget (don't forget) to come and
Pick up your, oh feelings (oh, pick up your feelings)
Don't leave no pieces
Oh, oh, oh woah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
