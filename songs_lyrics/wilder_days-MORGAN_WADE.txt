Hand in my hair and you said I looked pretty
You're so devious, you rolled in
From the Windy City, yeah
I ain't got a clear view
Tell me what you want me to do, and
You tell me every single secret in your mind
Come on, baby, we got nothing but time
You say I am too young for you
You're scared I'm too right for you
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You got a secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
The way you move your hands across my body
I'm kissin' you in a hotel lobby
Baby, I don't wanna lose this feeling.
You're giving me something to believe in
And who were you before I knew your name?
Were you drunk at midnight waiting for the train?
You could have been anyone back then
Just another kid reaching for the wind
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke,
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You got a secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
What were you like when you were a little wilder?
Why don't you show me?
Why don't you show me?
What you were like when you got a little higher?
Just for tonight, just for tonight
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You got a secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
I wish I had known you in your wilder days
